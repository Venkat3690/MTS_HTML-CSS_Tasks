    <h2>HTML Lists</h2>
    <p>HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists. There are different type of lists that can be able to displayed on the webpage.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered Lists</li>
        <li>Ordered Lists</li>
        <li>Description Lists</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
        <dt>1. Unordered Lists</dt>
        <dd>Unordered lists are lists that are displayed with bullets. An unordered list starts with the ul tag. Each list item starts with the li tag. The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Technical Skills: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>CPP</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <dt>2. Ordered Lists</dt>
        <dd>An ordered list starts with the ol tag. Each list item starts with the li tag.The list items will be marked with numbers by default
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Core Competencies</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Problem Solving</li>
            <li>Teamwork & Collaboration</li>
            <li>Good Communication</li>
            <li>Critical Thinking</li>
            <li>Aptitude & Reasoning</li>
            <li>Project Management</li>
        </ol>
        </dd>
        <dt>3. Description Lists</dt>
        <dd>HTML also supports description lists. A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term. The dl tag defines the description list, the dt tag defines the term (name), and the dd tag describes each term
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Projects:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>EFFICIENT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL: NLP DRIVEN TEXT SUMMARIZATION AND 
                KEYWORD EXTRACTION</dt>
                <dd><br>
                    The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced system for automatic text summarization and keyword extraction using natural language processing techniques and Transformers algorithm. This system aims to efficiently process text from the given input text, distilling it into concise summaries and extracting relevant keywords. The goal is to significantly reduce the time and effort required for information gathering and comprehension, thereby aiding users in quickly accessing and understanding the core content of extensive texts
            </dd>
            <dt><br>APPLICATION AND DATABASE ORCHESTRATION USING KUBERNETES</dt>
            <dd><br>
                The application and database orchestration using Kubernetes project focuses on leveraging the Kubernetes container orchestration platform to deploy, manage, and scale applications and databases. The project aims to automate and streamline the deployment and management of applications and databases, providing a resilient infrastructure for containerized workloads.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        </dd>

    <p>So, These are the three types of lists that can used to make lists as our requirement.</p>
